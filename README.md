A mad libs generator is a fun game that is usually played for fun.

This python project is a good start for the beginner level as it has concepts like strings, variables, and concatenation. Mad Libs Generator teaches to manipulate user-inputted data as the Mad Libs refer to a series of inputs that a user enters. The input from the user could be anything. After all the inputs are entered the application takes all the data and arranges it to build a story template. 

It will be fun to read aloud the stories after filling in the blanks. :D
